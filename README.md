## Stumbling Blocks 
I had no issues creating this assignment. When I ran the Lighthouse report, I noticed my score for accessibility was 100 but SEO and others were lower. I made the edits I could. For example, instead of linking to the images on the web I downloaded them and added the images to the file for quicker loading after resizing them. When I ran the report again, my score significantly improved. This was the only change I knew how to do and understood. In the SEO section, it says that I don't have a meta description but I do so that was a little confusing.
